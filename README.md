# Simple Encryption

This project implements a simple encryption algorithm in Python. It takes a string of text (cleartext) and a key as input, and performs encryption to convert the cleartext into an encrypted form. The encrypted data is then stored in a file named "encrypted.txt".

## Features

- Encryption of text using a simple algorithm
- Support for alphanumeric characters, symbols, and whitespace
- Randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV) for added security
- Command-line interface for easy usage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/xqxqn/simple-encryption.git
